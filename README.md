# Project 3: Mini Challenge #3

## Summary 
In disasters, people reach out to friends and family to check in and discuss what they see happening around them. The city and its emergency response teams are hoping to gain an understanding of the issues facing the citizenry they canâ€™t get through seismic readings and survey responses. They are looking to you to help them turn social media posts into an information source helping guide them as to where to focus efforts and what the concerns of the populace are.

## The Challenge [(link)](https://vast-challenge.github.io/2019/MC3.html)
The City has been using Y*INT to communicate with its citizens, even post-earthquake. However, City officials needs additional information to determine the best way to allocate emergency resources across all neighborhoods of St. Himark. Your task, using your visual analytics on the community Y*INT data, is to determine the types of problems that are occurring across the St. Himark. Then, advise the City on how to prioritize the distribution of resources. Keep in mind that not all sources on Y*INT are reliable, and that priorities may change over time as the state of neighborhoods also changes.

1. Using visual analytics, characterize conditions across the city and recommend how resources should be allocated at 5 hours and 30 hours after the earthquake. Include evidence from the data to support these recommendations. Consider how to allocate resources such as road crews, sewer repair crews, power, and rescue teams. Limit your response to 1000 words and 12 images.

2. Identify at least 3 times when conditions change in a way that warrants a re-allocation of city resources. What were the conditions before and after the inflection point? What locations were affected? Which resources are involved? Limit your response to 1000 words and 10 images.

3. Take the pulse of the community. How has the earthquake affect life in St. Himark? What is the community experiencing outside the realm of the first two questions? Show decision makers summary information and relevant/characteristic examples. Limit your response to 800 words and 8 images

4. The data for this challenge can be analyzed either as a static collection or as a dynamic stream of data, as it would occur in a real emergency. Describe how you analyzed the data - as a static collection or a stream. How do you think this choice affected your analysis? Limit your response to 200 words and 3 images.

## Our Plan

1. We will characterize conditions by...

Resources will be recomended by...
(Road crews, sewer repair crews, power, and rescue teams)

2. Identify at least 3 times when conditions change in a way that warrants a re-allocation of city resources. 

What were the conditions before and after the inflection point? 

What locations were affected? 


3. Take the pulse of the community. (See what the wellbeing is like)
